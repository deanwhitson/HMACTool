    - The request URI
    - Request timestamp
    - Base 64 string representation of the request payload (request body)
	
	generate a HASH by SHA256(hashing algorithm) -- > you need to use the Private Secret API Key which was initially provided by the server
	
oncce the client has geenrated the hash then the client needs to send the hash in the request header using the custome scheme "hmacauth"
